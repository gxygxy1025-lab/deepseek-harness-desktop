## Windows Desktop

DeepSeek Harness Desktop brings the complete DSH Web surface to a Windows EXE. It does not rewrite the interface: a hardened Electron window launches the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh` host locally and loads every plugin and skin from this repository unchanged.

[Download the Windows x64 installer](https://github.com/ningbainb/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases/latest) · [Desktop technical guide](docs/desktop.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

| Lossless original surface | Desktop Extension Dock |
| --- | --- |
| ![Desktop startup](docs/screenshots/desktop-startup.png) | ![Plugin and skill Extension Dock](docs/screenshots/desktop-extension-dock.png) |

- Keeps the task board, Git graph, right panel, SSH, mobile remote, live stats, pet, and every skin;
- Uses an isolated `desktop` profile without overwriting an existing DSH setup, and binds only to loopback;
- Adds crash recovery, sanitized rotating logs, window-state restore, strict navigation, and denied-by-default permissions;
- Adds a dock for transactional community DSH bundle management and safe discovery/import of project, DSH, and Agents skills;
- Bundles official DSH, pnpm, and native dependencies, so users do not need a separate Node.js installation.

The public build is not signed with a commercial code-signing certificate, so Windows SmartScreen may report an unknown publisher. Download only from this project's Releases and verify SHA-256. The default install location is tested; avoid unusually long custom paths because legacy Win32 components may still hit the 260-character limit.

dsh-web-ui is a collection of plugins and skins for the DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Web UI: a task board, a Git graph, the right panel, mobile remote control, remote connection, a whale-girl pet, live token statistics, and the Skin Center. Every plugin can be installed individually, or all at once through the aggregate packages.

## Feature Plugins

### Task Board

Open it from the sidebar. Tasks are organized into five columns: Planned, To-do, In Progress, Done, and Failed. Clicking "Run" on a card hands the task to a real DSH agent session; when it finishes, the card status updates automatically. To review what happened, jump directly into the execution session for the full transcript.

Tasks also support scheduled execution: configure a cron expression in the detail view (e.g. auto-upgrade DSH at 23:00 daily, generate a weekly report at 09:00 every Monday), and the task runs on its own at the scheduled time.

| Multi-column board | Scheduled execution |
| --- | --- |
| ![Task board](docs/screenshots/09-task-board.png) | ![Scheduled task detail](docs/screenshots/10-task-board-detail-cron.png) |

### Git Graph

The branch picker above the input box handles branch switching and commit history browsing; the Git graph visualizes branch lanes and commit history, making it easy to trace changes along the timeline even in large repositories.

![Git graph](docs/screenshots/04-git-graph.png)

### Right Panel

When a project session is open, two panels appear to the right of the chat area — "Preview" and "Files/Changes":

- **File tree**: browse the working directory; click a file to open it in the preview panel, click a folder row to expand it, and search for files by name;
- **Preview**: multi-tab preview for markdown, HTML, code, diff, CSV, PDF, Office, images and plain text, with source/preview switching, split-screen editing and saving;
- **Changes (SCM)**: a real git changes panel with stage / unstage / discard;
- Panel widths are draggable (double-click a handle to reset), and the collapsed state plus widths persist per project;
- All seven skins adapt the right panel — switching skins restyles the panels to match the theme.

### Whale-Girl Pet

A whale girl who lives at the edge of the interface and switches animations with the agent's state: thinking, waiting, working, celebrating. Click her to interact (pet her head), feed her dried fish to raise affinity, and grow her from a baby whale to "deep-sea bond". She can be renamed, dragged to any position, or hidden whenever you want.

| Working companion | Interaction panel |

### Live Token Stats

Real-time usage shown directly below the input box: generation speed (TPS), LLM time, context usage, cache hit rate, and input / output token counts — the cost of every generation stays visible at a glance.

![Live token stats](docs/screenshots/18-live-stats.png)

### Mobile Remote Control

The phone icon at the bottom of the sidebar opens the pairing panel: scan the QR code (or copy the link) to pair, and the phone lands on a standalone mobile surface that remote-controls the current dsh web workspace — browse and create sessions, send and receive messages, switch models and reasoning effort, and adjust the permission preset, all in sync with the desktop. Pairing tokens are one-time and time-limited; "Stop" revokes every paired device at any time. The QR defaults to the LAN, or turn on the cloudflared public tunnel so the phone can pair from any network.

| Chat (folded reasoning & tool calls) | Model & reasoning-effort picker |

### Remote Connection

The "SSH" sidebar entry opens the remote-ops panel. Hosts support key / password auth and one-click import from `~/.ssh/config`; config lives in `~/.dsh/dsh-ssh.json`. Real operations on configured hosts:

- **Web terminal**: xterm.js PTY with live output and auto-fit;
- **File transfer**: SFTP upload / download with progress and a remote directory browser;
- **Port forwarding**: local tunnels to remote internal services (databases, APIs, admin consoles), bound to 127.0.0.1 only;
- **Cluster runs**: one command across many hosts concurrently, filtered by alias / environment / tags;
- **Agent direct control**: agents share the same host config — just say "check xxx" in chat and the agent runs remote commands for you.

### Settings Hub

All family plugins' toggles and parameters live under "Settings > Plugin config", and changes apply immediately.

## Skins

The skin center ships seven skins, each supporting try-on before applying: preview applies instantly and reverts fully on exit; once you are satisfied, apply it with one click.

### Windows XP (Luna)

A faithful recreation of the classic Luna interface: blue gradient window chrome, a green Start button, the Bliss blue-sky desktop, and square corners throughout.

![Windows XP skin](docs/screenshots/16-skin-xp-light.png)

### Minecraft Voxel

Inspired by the Minecraft main menu: a pixel-art panorama skybox rotates slowly behind the interface, buttons adopt the gray stone slab style, and inputs become wooden sign posts.

![Minecraft skin](docs/screenshots/15-skin-minecraft-light.png)

### Blue Fantasy

Whale artwork lies beneath translucent panes, wrapped in a periwinkle-indigo palette — particularly striking in dark mode.

![Blue Fantasy dark](docs/screenshots/17-skin-blue-fantasy-dark.png)

### Whale Song

The deep-sea whale-goddess theme: a text-free ambience painting (a blue-haired goddess with a whale pod on the left, an ice-blue constellation grid with gold-thread accents, and generous open water on the right) sits beneath translucent panes, wrapped in an ice-blue / cyan / navy / cobalt palette — with a night-cruise dark variant.

![Whale Song light](docs/screenshots/24-skin-whale-song-light.png) · ![Whale Song dark](docs/screenshots/25-skin-whale-song-dark.png)

Three more: QQ2008 Retro (crystal blue with penguin motifs), Tonghuashun Trading (market elements woven into the interface), and Dragon Heir (cinnabar dragon seal theme).
