# Community Group Entry Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Make QQ group 1105158177 immediately discoverable from the product site and repository README, with a verified one-click join link and scannable QR code.

**Architecture:** Keep the download CTA first, then add a high-contrast community CTA beside it and a compact community link in the fixed header. Expand the existing community section into a two-column join card with the supplied QR image, verified Tencent short link, and copyable group number. Mirror the same information near the top of both README files.

**Tech Stack:** Static HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, Markdown, GitHub Pages.
